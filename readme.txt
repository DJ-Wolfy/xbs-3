Programmed by DJWolfy

Xtreme battle simulator 3 is the peak of the series' evolution: it runs on a lightweight open source audiogame engine, and all of the code is freely modifiable. It comes packed with a rich library of moves.
How to play?
All menus are self explanatory and will teach you how to play as you go along. Other than, it's advised to look at move scripts to find out how they all work.
